If your business issues digital passes—such as boarding passes, event tickets, coupons, or loyalty cards—in Apple .pkpass file format, you're likely overlooking a major issue: Android users can’t open or receive updates for Apple passes natively.

iPhone users enjoy a seamless experience through Apple Wallet. But for the **70% of global smartphone users on Android**, the experience is broken—**unless you use PassMate's Push Notification Services**.

--- 
## No Native Pass Support on Android
iPhones come with **Apple Wallet** pre-installed, allowing users to easily open and manage .pkpass files. Apple also provides **APNS (Apple Push Notification Service)** to **pass issuers**, enabling them to send real-time updates and alerts directly to Apple Wallet.

**This gives iOS users:** 
✅ Native .pkpass support
✅ Real-time updates when details change (e.g., gate or boarding time)
✅ Time- and location-based push notifications

**But on Android devices:** 
❌ There’s no native Passbook or Wallet app
❌ No push notification system exists for .pkpass files
❌ Passes do not auto-update, even when information changes

**Result:** Android users often miss critical updates, and **pass issuers lose the ability to communicate with Android users** after the pass is issued.

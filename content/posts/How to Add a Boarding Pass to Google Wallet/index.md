In today’s digital travel experience, boarding passes are no longer printed sheets but sleek digital files saved on your phone. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you might be wondering: which airlines support Apple Wallet and Google Wallet for boarding passes? And what if your phone can’t display boarding passes properly?  

This guide focuses on digital tickets, how to use them on your mobile device, and the best Apple Wallet alternative for Android and Huawei phone users

## How to Add a Boarding Pass to Apple Wallet	
Many major airlines around the world let iPhone users store their boarding passes in the Apple Wallet. After checking in online or through the airline’s app, travelers can tap a button to **“Add to Apple Wallet.”** This adds the boarding pass to their phone in a Apple special format called **.pkpass**  

Using Apple Wallet makes travel easier by showing your boarding pass on the lock screen when it’s time to board and by sending real-time updates like gate changes or delays — **as long as the airline supports push notifications and updates the pass**. Not all airlines use this feature, but many major carriers do.

Google Wallet support is growing, but it’s still more limited compared to Apple Wallet. Some airlines let Android users add boarding passes to Google Wallet through their mobile apps, but support can vary by region and device.

## Why Google Wallet Doesn’t Support Apple Wallet Passes
A common misconception is that Apple Wallet and Google Wallet use the same type of pass format. In fact, they don’t:

Apple Wallet uses the **.pkpass** format (used widely in emails and iOS apps).
Google Wallet uses a **JSON-based format** that is not compatible with .pkpass files.

If you receive a boarding pass in .pkpass format, you can’t open it directly in Google Wallet unless the airline provides a separate pass version made for Android.

**Google Wallet Limitations in Some Regions**
Besides the format difference, Google Wallet isn’t available in all countries. If you’re in countries like Turkey, China, or parts of Africa, you may not even be able to download or use the Google Wallet.

## Why Apple Wallet Passes Don’t Work on Android by Default
Even though many airlines send boarding passes in .pkpass format, this file type is made for iPhones. Android phones can’t open .pkpass files natively — unless a third-party app is installed. This often leads to confusion among Android users who receive these files but have no app to view them.

## Best Apple Wallet Alternative for Boarding Passes on Android
The best Pass Wallet solution for Android users is an app called **PassMate: Wallet for Passes**

It is a free Android Wallet (no ads, no subscriptions) available on Google Play and Huawei AppGallery. It allows users to:
Open and use Apple Wallet Passes on Android
Display time- and location-based notifications (like Apple Wallet)
Receive gate updates or boarding changes in real time
Keep all boarding passes in one place — even without an internet connection

**PassMate: Wallet for Passes** also provides a push notification service just like Apple Wallet.  
Any pass provider (such as an airline or ticketing company) can register for a **free API token** and:
Send time/location-based alerts to users
Update boarding pass content (e.g., gate changes, flight delays)
Push updated passes to the user’s device automatically

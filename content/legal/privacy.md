This Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use and share it, the safeguards in place to protect it, and the rights you have regarding your personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").

1. Information We Collect
We may collect the following types of information:
• Personal Information: If you contact us for support, we may collect your name, email address, or other contact details.
• Usage Data: Non-personal data such as device type, operating system, and app usage patterns.
• Pass Data: The App allows you to store digital passes (e.g., tickets, loyalty cards, coupons). This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
• Push Notifications: We may store a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Huawei Cloud Messaging (HCM) token to send notifications. You can disable push notifications through your device settings or by uninstalling the App.
• Log Data & Unique Identifiers: In case of an error, we collect diagnostic data (e.g., IP address, device name, OS version, and app configuration at the time of the error). While this data is generally non-personal, we treat it as personal if it can reasonably identify you.
• Technical Data: We collect non-personal technical information such as device model, OS version, time zone, country, error reports, diagnostic logs, API calls, and other logs. This data is used to maintain, support, and improve the App.
 
2. How We Collect Information
We collect information in two ways:
1. Automatically: Through SDKs and tracking technologies when you interact with the App.
2. Voluntarily: When you provide information directly (e.g., customer support inquiries).
 
3. Data Sharing & Third Parties
We do not sell or rent your personal data. However, we may share it under the following circumstances:
• With Your Consent: If you explicitly allow it.

• Policy Enforcement: To investigate policy violations, prevent fraud, or protect users.
• Corporate Transactions: If PassMate Alliance is acquired or merged with another entity.
• Service Providers: Third-party vendors assisting with analytics, storage, fraud prevention, and notification services.
• Affiliate Partners: We may partner with affiliates for promotional activities or business collaborations. In such cases, limited non-personal data or personal data may be shared to facilitate these partnerships. Any data shared with affiliates will be governed by strict contractual agreements ensuring compliance with GDPR and CCPA.
 
4. Technical Infrastructure & Tracking Technologies
Our App and Services rely on cloud infrastructure and various tracking technologies to enhance performance, security, and user experience.

We retain your personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law. We may delete or anonymize data at our discretion if no longer needed.
 
7. Security Measures
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or disclosure. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is completely secure. If you suspect a security breach, please contact us immediately.
 
8. International Data Transfers
We store and process data on cloud servers located in the EU, US, and Asia. If your data is transferred outside of your jurisdiction, we ensure it remains protected under applicable legal frameworks, including standard contractual clauses for EU users.
 
9. Children's Privacy
Our App is not directed at children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child has provided personal information, they should contact us to request its deletion.
